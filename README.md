This is an end-to-end project for real estate price prediction in the Bangaluru area in India. The project involves building a regression model using the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle. The model is integrated into a Python Flask server, which serves HTTP requests. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and allows users to enter home square footage, number of bedrooms, etc. The website then calls the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price. The project is designed to predict home prices in the Bangaluru area.
